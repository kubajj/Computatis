<!-- @vuese:quadratic-equation:methods:start -->
|Method|Description|Parameters|
|---|---|---|
|randomNumber|this method generates a random number in the interval that was specified in the parentheses|minimal value;&nbsp;maximal value|
|sign|this method simplifies the process of having numbers with negative value while not including 0|-|
|resetAll|this method resets all variables that have been changed and will be used in the next call of genTask|-|
|genTask|this method generates the task|-|
|controlA|this method handles special values before x^2|-|
|controlB|this method handles special values before x|-|
|controlC|this method adds + operand where it is needed before c and also handles special values of c term|-|
|unmodTaskGenerator|this method generates basic unmodified task|-|
|modTaskGenerator|this method changes the unmodtask to be more complicated by adding right part (after =)|-|
|check|this method handles results submitted by user and their evaluation and correction|-|
|checkOfTheDiscForm|this mathod handles the correction of inputs in discriminant formula|inputValue = user input;&nbsp;right = correct value;&nbsp;state = variable that is supposed to be changed|
|discrime|simplify the change from whole disc formula to disc with inputs|-|
|hideOK|hides OK button|-|
